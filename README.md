# pcb-design
personal pcb learning. if i have time, i'll add resources to help you


i am following [ai03's guide to pcbs](https://wiki.ai03.com/books/pcb-design/chapter/pcb-designer-guide). i'll see how i'm do with that for the next while.

## components required

all of these needs to be surface mount hand soldierable. i'll try to find them from the same company (mouser) but amazon is pretty good.

 - atmega32u2
    - at 
 - kalih hotswap sockets
    - available at [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32959301642.html) and [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Hot-swappable-Socket-CPG151101S11-Mechanical-Keyboard/dp/B07K8CCMQZ) amazon has 50pcs, aliexpress has options from 30pcs to 110pcs (aliexpress is cheaper but takes weeks) 
 - ws2812b LED
    - available at [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/BTF-LIGHTING-Flexible-Individually-Addressable-Non-waterproof/dp/B01CDTEJBG) mininum 60 leds to 300 leds.
 - tsx-3225 Crystal
    - available at [mouser](https://nz.mouser.com/c/passive-components/frequency-control-timing-devices/crystals/?m=Epson&series=TSX-3225), i'll find the exact product soon.
 - resistors 
    - [jaycar](https://www.jaycar.co.nz/components-electromechanical/resistors/metal-film/c/2AA?sort=popularity-desc&q) has all the ones needed with metal films.
 - capacitors
    - available at [mouser](https://nz.mouser.com/c/passive-components/capacitors/ceramic-capacitors/mlccs-multilayer-ceramic-capacitors/multilayer-ceramic-capacitors-mlcc-smd-smt/?type=Surface%20Mount%20MLCC)
 - diode
    - [mouser](https://nz.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Micro-Commercial-Components-MCC/1N4148W-TP?qs=KFo7JewZbUH7wCMabJ4EeQ%3D%3D) has a diode that perfectly fits my footprint.
 - button
    - [mouser](https://nz.mouser.com/ProductDetail/E-Switch/TL3342F160QG?qs=6C6BR4UgC3N80rVVEktZJA%3D%3D) has a button with the same footprint as the one i use in the pcb design.
 - usbc connector
    - [mouser](https://nz.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Molex/216990-0003?qs=DRkmTr78QASn0GILUGAYCA%3D%3D) has a molex usb connector which i cross referenced with my footprint, fits perfectly.
