# pcb-design
personal pcb learning. if i have time, i'll add resources to help you


i am following [ai03's guide to pcbs](https://wiki.ai03.com/books/pcb-design/chapter/pcb-designer-guide). i'll see how i'm do with that for the next while.

## components required

all of these needs to be surface mount hand soldierable. i'll try to find them from the same company (mouser or jaycar) but amazon is pretty good. all of these don't include shipping.
